# BRAND.md — Prime Cyprus

## What We Do
We help digital economy builders relocate to Cyprus.

## Audience

### Already wealthy
- Tech founders (crypto, AI, SaaS)
- Senior remote workers ($300k+)
- Investors (crypto, stocks, assets)

### Wealth incoming
- AI operators and orchestrators scaling agent businesses
- Early employees at AI/crypto companies approaching vest or liquidity events

---

## Positioning
- Not a law firm. Not a generic real estate agent. Not a relocation checklist service.
- The smart friend who knows Cyprus inside out — tax, property, lifestyle, and the audience's world.
- We sit between residency/tax advisory and premium real estate. Nobody else does both well for this audience.
- We speak the language of tech founders and investors — we don't need to explain what a holding structure is.

### Core line
"We help digital economy builders relocate to Cyprus."

---

## Tone of Voice
- Dark, premium, minimal — confident without being loud
- Intelligent without being cold
- Authoritative but never arrogant
- Short sentences. No filler. No fluff.
- Feels like advice from a smart, well-connected friend — not a sales pitch
- Think: quiet confidence. The kind of brand that doesn't need to prove itself.

---

## The Lifestyle Angle
Cyprus is not just a tax address. Lead with the life:
- Mediterranean climate, 320 days of sunshine
- 3 hours from most of Europe
- Safe, English-speaking, EU member state
- Growing community of like-minded tech founders and investors
- Beautiful coastline, food, pace of life
- A place people actually want to live — not just a structure on paper

## Content & Copy Rules

### Language to use
- "Optimized", "structured", "efficient" — not "cheap" or "affordable"
- "Digital economy", "tech founders", "investors" — not "expats" or "emigrants"
- "Crypto" is fine — it means money and wealth in context. Use naturally, not dominantly in headlines.
- "Residency" over "emigration" — sounds more intentional and less permanent
- Specific tax numbers are fine in body copy (8% crypto, 2.5% IP Box, 0% dividends for non-doms)

### Language to avoid
- "Blockchain" — infrastructure, irrelevant to our services
- "Dream home", "paradise island", "your slice of heaven" — generic real estate clichés
- "Cheap", "affordable", "budget" — wrong positioning
- "Act now", "limited spots", "don't miss out" — no urgency tactics
- "Pursuant to", "aforementioned", "herewith" — no legal/corporate stiffness
- Never promise specific tax savings in writing — legal risk
- Never claim to provide legal advice directly

### Design & UX rules
- No aggressive CTAs on the hero — only value-exchange CTAs (free tax guide, newsletter)
- No pop-ups except for genuine value exchange (email capture)
- No stock photos of suits shaking hands
- No bright colors, busy layouts, or cluttered navigation
- Don't over-explain tax mechanics on main pages — link to detail pages
- Don't talk down to the audience — they're sophisticated

### Competitive differentiation
- Global English-first audience (not limited to one nationality)
- Premium positioning — not competing on price
- Actual property listings (competitors don't have this)
- Legal background adds credibility
- Lifestyle angle — not just tax efficiency

---

## What Makes Us Different (vs competitors like Cyprus Consult)
- They target Dutch/Belgians. We're global.
- They're process-heavy and dry. We're premium and human.
- They guide on property. We list and transact property.
- They don't deeply understand the tech/crypto audience. We are that audience.
- They focus on tax rules. We focus on the life you build.
